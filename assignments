Write a short personal example from your own experience (academic, professional, or personal life) that illustrates the difference between analysis and analytics.
Your example should:
Clearly describe a situation where data or information was involved.
Explain how analysis was used (i.e., reviewing data to understand what or why something happened).
Explain how analytics could be (or was) used (i.e., using data to predict or optimize future outcomes).
Include a clear analogy or contrast between the two, in your own words.
