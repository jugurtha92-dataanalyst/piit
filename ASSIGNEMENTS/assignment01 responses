In my MetroCar project, I illustrated the difference between data analysis and analytics by examining the customer funnel 
for a ride-sharing app. Using SQL, I performed data analysis to query and explore customer behavior at each stage 
of the funnel—signup, activation, and retention—identifying drop-off points and usage patterns. 
I then used Tableau to visualize these findings, providing clear, data-driven insights. 
Transitioning into analytics, I interpreted these insights to suggest strategies for improving user engagement and conversion, 
such as optimizing onboarding flows or targeting specific user segments. This showed how data analysis helps describe what is happening, 
while analytics focuses on what actions to take next.
And some of the actions sujested were: 
    Reduce the prices during low demand 
    Give some bonus to driver in some slow areas 
    Give some coupons to riders to get more customers
